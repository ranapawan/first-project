# first-project
hi frnd this is my first depositery
 When you love yourself more then things simply become lighter and easier. You wonâ€™t make as many mountains out of molehills (or out of plain air) as you used to. Or beat yourself up or drag yourself down over mistakes or temporary setbacks
 
 Nice edits! Now that you have changes in a branch off of master, you can open a pull request.
